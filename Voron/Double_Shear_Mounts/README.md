# Double Shear Mounts

These are decoupler mounts for voron-based gantries for using stepper motors in double shear. Allows for running higher, spec belt tensions and also just generally takes load off of the motors. Intended for use with DoubleT's [AluminumG gantry](https://github.com/3DPrintingMods/VoronTrident-AluminumG) parts.
